## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction

*Laravel Theme* provides a simple way to manage themes on a Laravel app.

The component 

Compatible with Laravel 5.

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation

At `composer.json` of your Laravel installation, add the following require line:

``` json
{
    "require": {
        "intentor/laravel-theme": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

Run `composer update` to add the package to your Laravel app.

At `config/app.php`, add the Service Provider and the Facade:

```php
    'providers' => [
		'Intentor\LaravelTheme\ServiceProvider',
    ]

	//...

    'aliases' => [
        ''Form' => 'Intentor\LaravelTheme\Facade'
    ]
```

## <a id="quick-start"></a>Quick start

### Creating a theme

To create a theme, first add a `themes` folder to the `resources` folder of your app.

Inside the `themes` folder, any folder you create will represent a theme. For each theme folder, add a `views` folder, in which you'll create all the views for the theme.

So, the folder structure will look like this:

* resources
    * themes
        * [theme folder]
            * views

### Setting a theme

To set a theme, call `Theme::set('theme_name')` anywhere you want to change your theme.

**Remember**: the name of theme is the name of the folder that represents the theme at the `resources/themes` folder.

## <a id="best-practices"></a>Best practices

1\. Add any assets (images, CSS, JS, etc.) for the theme in a specific folder inside the `public` folder.

2\. If you're using a task manager (like [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) or [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)) it's recommended to add assets at an `assets` folder inside the theme and then move the files to the public location. 

* resources
    * themes
        * [theme folder]
            * assets
                * css/sass/less
                * img
                * js
            * views


3\. Or, when on Unix systems, create a symbolic link at the `public` folder to the `assets` folder of the theme.

* resources
    * themes
        * [theme folder]
            * assets
                * css/sass/less
                * img
                * js
            * views
* public
    * [theme folder] -> points to resouces/themes/[theme folder]

4\. Create shared views at the `resources/views` folder.

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

1. Currently it's not possible to have views inside the theme with the same name of shared views.
2. Asset management can be rather awkward, given the views for the theme are outside the `public` folder.
